    <!-- <h1>International Workshop on Blockchain and Web3.0 (BWEB3 2025)</h1> -->
    <p align="justify">The emergence of blockchain technology has catalyzed a paradigm shift in how digital systems are designed, governed, and experienced. As we move toward the era of Web3.0—a decentralized, user-centric evolution of the internet—blockchain stands as a foundational pillar, enabling trustless interactions, programmable value exchange, and new forms of digital ownership. This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and industry leaders to explore the latest advancements, challenges, and opportunities at the intersection of blockchain and the rapidly evolving Web3.0 landscape.</p>
    <p align="justify">Web3.0 envisions an internet where users regain sovereignty over their data, identities, and digital assets, powered by decentralized protocols and interoperable networks. Blockchain technologies, with their inherent transparency, immutability, and programmability, are central to realizing this vision. From decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and decentralized identity (DID) systems, the convergence of blockchain and Web3.0 is unlocking unprecedented possibilities for innovation across industries.</p>
    <p align="justify">This workshop seeks to address critical questions: How can blockchain protocols be scaled and optimized to support the demands of Web3.0 applications? What are the emerging patterns for decentralized governance, data privacy, and interoperability in Web3.0 ecosystems? How can smart contracts, tokenization, and decentralized storage reshape digital economies and social networks? What are the ethical, regulatory, and sustainability considerations as blockchain and Web3.0 technologies mature?</p>

  <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
  <p align="justify" style="padding-right:2em;">Blockchain technologies offer powerful tools for building robust, tamper-resistant, and decentralized data infrastructures. As data security faces mounting challenges in complex, heterogeneous, and distributed network environments, blockchain is emerging as a promising foundation for ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In this talk, we present a set of solutions that leverage blockchain to address modern data security challenges. First, we design wireless consensus protocols that remain robust under adversarial signal interference, enabling secure agreement in complex communication environments. Second, we develop decentralized storage systems that are scalable, succinct, and Byzantine-resilient, ensuring secure and efficient data sharing across untrusted nodes. Third, we introduce cross-chain interoperability frameworks that enable atomic, fair, and privacy-preserving data exchanges across heterogeneous blockchain ecosystems. These efforts demonstrate how blockchain technologies can be systematically applied to enhance data security across a range of environments and applications.</p>

  <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
  <p align="justify" style="padding-right:2em;">Deriving from the development of the Internet, digital identity is becoming a virtual solution to identifying individuals, while considering flexible customer-centered applications. However, a few challenges still exist in this field, e.g., privacy leakage, since individuals’ identities generally are governed by a centralized setting. Blockchain technology has provided an alternative for achieving a privacy-preserving decentralized identity solution. This talk will mainly cover following contents, including the mechanism of blockchain-based distributed digital identities, security issues, and solutions.</p>
