            <p align="justify">BCRA 2025 will be held from 10th to 11th August 2025 at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR. We seek original submissions regarding blockchain research and applications that detail novel techniques, introduce advanced methodologies, investigate new applications, and propose promising directions.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Topics of Interest</h3>
            <p align="justify">The BCRA 2025 seeks original submissions regarding blockchain research and applications that detail novel techniques, introduce advanced methodologies, investigate new applications, and propose promising directions. The topics of interest for the conference include, but are not limited to:</p>
            
            <li>Blockchain theory & protocols (consensus, interoperability, etc)</li>
              
            <li>Blockchain architecture, systems, and tools</li>
            
            <li>Smart contract</li>
            
            <li>Security and privacy of blockchains</li>
            
            <li>Blockchain governance</li>
            
            <li>Blockchain applications (DID, DeFi, DePIN, etc)</li>
            
            <li>Web3 and digital assets</li>
            
          </div>
          <div>
            <p align="justify" style="margin-top:20px;">The conference seeks original papers of two types:</p>
            
              <li><b>Research Papers: </b>These papers report original research on the above topics and will be evaluated on the significance of the problem, the novelty of the solution, advancement beyond prior work, sufficient supporting evidence, and clarity of the presentation.</li>
            
              <!-- <li><b>Experimentation and Deployment Papers: </b>These papers describe complete systems, platforms, and/or comprehensive experimental evaluations of alternative designs and solutions to well-known problems. The emphasis during the review of these papers will be more on the demonstrated usefulness and potential impact of the contributions, the extensive experimentation involved, and the quality and weight of the lessons learned.</li> -->
            
              <!-- <li><b>Big Ideas Papers: </b>These are papers that have the potential to open up new research directions. For such papers, the potential to motivate new research is more important than full experimental evaluation, though some preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of the approach or idea is important.</li> -->

              <li><b>Short Papers: </b>These papers hold up to the same standards and evaluation criteria of full research papers, but their content is presented in a more compact format.</li>

              <!-- <li><b>Work-in-progress (WIP) Papers (NEW for MW’2024): </b>These papers tackle significant problems but only present seeds of the solutions, initial evaluation results,  and preliminary discussions. The emphasis on the review for this papers will on the potential represented by the presented idea.</li> -->

            <h3>Key Changes and Conditions</h3>
            <li><b>Resubmissions to next cycle:</b> a research article rejected in the 1st Round (Fall Submission) can be resubmitted to the next cycle (Spring Submission) <b>if explicitly allowed by the final decision of the program committee</b>. Similarly, a research article rejected in the 2st Round (Spring Submission) can be resubmitted to the next cycle (Fall Submission 2025) if explicitly allowed by the final decision of the program committee. Authors, at submission time, will have to prove they have taken into account the provided reviews and made a reasonable effort to convey the efforts taken to improve their submission. Such resubmission will count as a new submission. In such scenarios, the reviews can be forwarded from one cycle to the next one, and, as much as possible, to the same set of reviews. You can think of this scenario as a <b>major review</b> decision.</li>
            <li><b>One-shot revision:</b> A paper submitted in a given round may receive a one-shot revision decision. Such a paper may be revised, given the information in the reviews, and resubmitted as part of the next review round. Such a revision decision will include a summary of the paper’s merits and a list of necessary changes required for the paper to be accepted at Middleware. Authors may then choose to resubmit a revised version of their work by addressing those needs by the deadline for the next round. Upon resubmission, the paper will be re-reviewed to judge whether it addresses the requirements requested; this review will be conducted, to the extent possible, by the same reviewers as the original review. Additional reviewers can be added. Papers receiving a revision decision for the 2nd Round of review (Spring Submission) will be invited to be resubmitted to the 1st Round (Fall Submission) for the next edition of the conference. You can think of this scenario as a <b>minor review</b> decision.</li>
            <li>Only papers in the research (including short) and experimentation/deployment track will be eligible for the one-shot revision decision. Big ideas papers are not eligible for a revise/resubmit decision; they may be shepherded before acceptance.</li>
            <li><b>Shepherding:</b> Any paper in any category may be accepted conditionally to complete a shepherding process. These papers can be considered something of a “minor revision”. Such a decision will also be accompanied by a list of straightforward changes (expected to be reasonably addressed in a short amount of time). At least one PC member will check these changes before being accepted.</li>

            <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
            <!-- <p align = "justify">Your submission must be made within the due date specified above for the specific rounds. Regular papers must have at most 12 pages of technical content, including text, figures, and appendices, but excluding any number of additional pages for bibliographic references. Short and WIP papers must not be longer than 6 pages of technical content including text, figures, and appendices, but excluding any additional pages for bibliographic references. Note that submissions must be doubly anonymous - authors’ names must not appear on the manuscript, and authors must make a good-faith attempt to anonymize their submissions. Submitted papers must adhere to the formatting instructions of the ACM SIGPLAN style, which can be found on the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">ACM template page</a>. The font size has to be set to 10pt. <br>Please submit papers to <a href="https://middleware2024r1.hotcrp.com/" target="_blank">https://middleware2024r1.hotcrp.com/</a> (Round 1) and <a href="https://middleware2024r2.hotcrp.com/" target="_blank">https://middleware2024r2.hotcrp.com/</a> (Round 2).</p>
            <p align = "justify">A paper submitted to ACM Middleware 2024 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for Middleware 2024, and it must be substantially different from any previously published work. All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings. ACM reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from ACM Digital Library) if none of the authors attends the conference to present their paper.</p>
            <p align = "justify">The Middleware 2024 conference proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library. The official publication date will be when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. Note that the official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. A list of papers accepted from the 1st Round review process (Fall submission) will be posted on the ACM Middleware 2024 website in May 2024. In October, when the full program is available, paper titles and abstracts will be posted for all accepted papers from the spring and fall deadlines.</p>
            <p align = "justify"><b>Note to Authors:</b> By submitting your article for distribution in this Special Interest Group publication, you now grant to ACM the following non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide rights:</p>
            
              <li>to publish in print on condition of acceptance by the editor</li>
            
              <li>to digitize and post your article in the electronic version of this publication</li>
            
              <li>to include the article in the ACM Digital Library and any Digital Library-related services</li>
            
              <li>to allow users to make a personal copy of the article for non-commercial, educational or research purposes</li>
            
            <p>However, as a contributing author, you retain the copyright to your article and ACM will refer requests for republication directly to you.</p> -->
	    <p>All submissions must be in English and in PDF format. Research papers should be 16-20 pages in length, while short papers should be 12-16 pages. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Please use the <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" target = _blank>Springer proceeding template</a>. All accepted papers will be published by Springer and will be indexed by EI Compendex.</p>
	    <p>Submissions to the BCRA 2025 conference that meet the above requirements can be made via the submission site <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=bcra2025" target = _blank>EasyChair</a> by the submission deadline.</p>

            <h3>Anonymity Requirements for Doubley-Anonymous Reviewing</h3>
            <p align="justify">Every research paper submitted to ACM Middleware 2024 will undergo a &#39;&#39;doubly-anonymous&#39;&#39; reviewing process: in addition to maintaining the anonymity of the reviewers of the papers, the PC members and reviewers will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure the anonymity of authorship, authors must at least do the following:</p>
            
              <li>Authors&#39; names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.</li>
            
              <li>Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper under review; these can be added to accepted papers upon submission of the camera-ready manuscript.</li>
            
              <li>Non-anonymized links to the authors’ online content must be removed.</li>
            
              <li>Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.</li>
            
              <li>The paper’s file name must not identify the authors of the paper.</li>
            
            
            <div style="margin-top:20px;">
              <p align="justify">Authors should also use care in referring to related past work. The solution is to reference past work in the third person (in the same way that one would reference work by anyone else). This allows you to set the context for your submission while at the same time preserving anonymity.</p>
              <p align="justify">Despite the anonymity requirements, authors should still include all relevant work, including their own; omitting them could reveal the author&#39;s identity by negation. However, self-references should be limited to the essential ones, and extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced. The goal is to preserve anonymity while allowing the reader to grasp the context of the submitted paper fully. It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines or potentially reveal the author's identity are subject to immediate rejection.</p>

          <div>
            <h3>Publication</h3>
            <p align="justify">Distinguished papers presented at the conference, after further revision, will be published in the journal of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/blockchain-research-and-applications" target = _blank>Blockchain: Research and Applications</a>.</a> (Impact Factor 6.9, CiteScore 11.3)</p>
