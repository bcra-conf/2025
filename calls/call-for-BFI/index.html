            <h1>International Workshop on Blockchain and Financial Intelligence (BFI 2025)</h1>
            <p align="justify">Blockchain technology, combined with advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), is dramatically reshaping the financial landscape. This convergence is powering new decentralized financial ecosystems (DeFi), enhancing transaction transparency, optimizing financial risk management, and enabling novel regulatory approaches. This workshop aims to investigate the dynamic relationship between blockchain, AI-driven financial analytics, decentralized finance (DeFi), and large-scale generative models, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize traditional finance and emerging fintech solutions within the Web 3.0 paradigm.</p>
            <p align="justify">The financial industry is increasingly leveraging blockchain to achieve decentralization, transparency, and immutable transaction records. Concurrently, AI and sophisticated large-scale models (such as ChatGPT and BloombergGPT) are enhancing decision-making, fraud detection, credit scoring, and predictive analytics. Web 3.0 frameworks amplify these advances by prioritizing interoperability, decentralized governance, and enhanced user empowerment, presenting new opportunities and challenges for financial technologies.</p>
            <p align="justify">This workshop seeks to address critical questions: How can blockchain and AI models synergize to foster transparency, security, and fairness in financial systems? How can large generative models augment DeFi protocols, risk management, and automated financial advisory services? What strategies and frameworks can effectively mitigate security vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, and regulatory complexities within blockchain-based financial systems?</p>
            <p align="justify">This workshop invites original research, case studies, and reviews at the intersection of blockchain, AI, large models, DeFi, fintech, and Web 3.0. Key themes include (but are not limited to):</p>

            <p align="justify">Each workshop proposal, not exceeding three pages of 11pt single-spaced text, in PDF format, should include the following information:</p>
            <ul class="default-ul">
              
                <li>the title of the workshop;</li>

            </ul>
            <p align="justify">Each workshop will organize its own submissions and reviewing procedures and will provide its own website. A link will be provided to the workshop’s website from the Middleware 2024 website. Workshop organizers will ensure that all accepted papers are peer reviewed and will need to upload camera ready and copyright agreements of all accepted papers in a timely manner through the ACM portal. Organizers will plan their workshop’s schedule so that: (i) the paper submission deadline falls after the main conference's second round notification date (Sept 8, 2024); (ii) authors are notified no later than October 20, 2024; and (iii) authors submit their camera-ready papers no later than October 27, 2024. Accepted workshop papers should be no longer than 6 pages in the standard ACM format. Note that at least one author of each accepted workshop paper must hold a full pre-conference registration, as must at least one workshop organizer. Workshop organizers are responsible for preparing the papers for their workshops in the format required by ACM. As in previous years, the Middleware conference organizers will provide companion proceedings including all workshop papers, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library. This is subject to the availability of their camera-ready papers by October 27, 2024.</p>
            <p align="justify">Middleware requires workshop organizers to use HotCRP (<a href="https://hotcrp.com/" target="_blank">https://hotcrp.com/</a>) to collect submissions,
              manage reviewing, and facilitate collection of material for the proceedings. HotCRP is free of charge
              for Middleware workshops and provides many useful tools, such as to manage copyright assignment,
              final-version submission, PDF checking, and proceedings construction.</p>
